In baseball, a team can provide a departing free agent player with a qualifying offer: a one-year contract whose monetary value is the average of the 125 highest salaries from the past season. 
Use the provided dataset to write a program or application that determines the monetary value of the upcoming qualifying offer and displays the amount along with any other relevant information or visualizations to the user. 

The default url of the raw data is https://questionnaire-148920.appspot.com/swe/data.html
